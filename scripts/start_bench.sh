 # On a successful start, nginx will daemonize by itself and doesn't need the
 # `&` to run in the background. However, if there is a problem it will exit
 # with a non-zero exit code, causing the script to exit immediately. In order
 # to give `after-start` a chance to report the reason, we add the `&` to
 # suppress the exit-on-failure.
 #
 # We provide the error log path using the -e option rather than via
 # configuration, since otherwise we get a spurious warning (see
 # https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34258894)
